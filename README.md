# Website Traffic Analysis & Visualization

## Project Description

This project analyzes website traffic data exported from Google Analytics–like sources to understand user behavior and traffic performance across different acquisition channels. The goal is to provide clear, actionable insights through data analysis and visualizations that support data-driven marketing and business decisions.

The analysis focuses on daily traffic trends, traffic source comparison, and bounce rate behavior. All results are presented in a clean and interpretable Jupyter Notebook, suitable for stakeholders with non-technical backgrounds.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze daily website traffic trends
* Compare total sessions by traffic source
* Evaluate user engagement using bounce rate metrics
* Create clear and readable visualizations
* Summarize insights in a business-oriented manner

## 🗄️ Dataset Overview

The dataset simulates a realistic website traffic export and contains the following columns:

| Column               | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| date                 | Date of the traffic record                       |
| source               | Traffic source (organic, paid, referral, social) |
| sessions             | Number of sessions                               |
| users                | Number of unique users                           |
| bounce_rate          | Percentage of single-page sessions               |
| avg_session_duration | Average session duration (seconds)               |

## 📈 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Daily Traffic Trend

* Aggregated sessions by date
* Visualized session growth over time using a line chart

### 2️⃣ Traffic by Source

* Grouped total sessions by acquisition channel
* Compared performance using bar charts

### 3️⃣ Bounce Rate Analysis

* Calculated average bounce rate per traffic source
* Identified channels with higher and lower engagement levels

---

## 📊 Visualizations

* Line chart: Daily sessions trend
* Bar chart: Total sessions by traffic source
* Bar chart: Average bounce rate by traffic source

All visualizations are designed for clarity and quick interpretation.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✅ Key Insights

* Organic traffic is the largest contributor to total sessions
* Organic traffic also shows the lowest average bounce rate, indicating higher user engagement
* Social traffic has the highest bounce rate, suggesting lower-quality visits
* Paid and referral traffic provide moderate but consistent contributions

These insights can help optimize marketing strategies and allocate resources more effectively.
